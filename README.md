# Enhanced New Tab
An enhanced new tab experience, for Firefox

This addon will transform Firefox's new tab page into a notebook, top-sites list, and searchfield.
Credit for the initial work on the "notebook", and the initial base for this project, goes to [wildskyf's "tab-notes"](https://github.com/wildskyf/tab-notes/)
