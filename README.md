# Enhanced New Tab

###An enhanced new tab experience, for Firefox

This addon will transform Firefox's new tab page into a notebook, links to weather and search, and a listing of top sites.

---

###Notes:

 - Top sites will be the same as those loaded in about:newtab.  Pinned sites on that page will be respectively pinned on this extension's page.  
 - Weather links to [wttr.in](http://wttr.in) and should show local weather based on your IP address.  

---

###ToDo:

[X] Add shortcuts along top (weather, search, etc)
[] Use most visited API to populate links 
[-] Add search engine box from about:newtab and relevant styling (Added search link)
[] Add settings page to choose color scheme (light, dark, greyscale, colorful)
